7. Videomixer
============

The videomixer element makes it possible to mix different videostreams together. Here is a CLI example:

    $ gst-launch-0.10 filesrc location=tvlogo.png ! pngdec ! alphacolor ! ffmpegcolorspace ! videobox border-alpha=0 alpha=0.5 top=-20 left=-200 ! videomixer name=mix ! ffmpegcolorspace ! autovideosink videotestsrc ! video/x-raw-yuv, width=320, height=240 ! mix.

You have to make a PNG image (100x100 px) to be able to run it. With the videobox element you can move the image around and add more alpha channels.

NEW COMPETITION! I can't figure out how to make a transparent alpha channel for the PNG in the pipeline above so if anyone makes it work the prize from example 3.2 will be given to this winner instead as the other one passed. TIA

UPDATE! An anonymous dude solved the problem with an alphacolor element, many thanks man.

In the next example we take the now working Mpeg2-Player -> (changed to MKV-Player) from example 3.2 and pump it with the stuff shown above.

Example 7.1

We implemented a new videomixer example that plays MP4 videos encoded with h264 and aac codecs with the PNG image. demuxer: qtdemux, decoders: avdec_h264 & avdec_aac
